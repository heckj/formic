# Formic üêú

Swift library to support IT Automation tasks.

## Overview

This is a library to support building IT automation tools in Swift, taking a lot of inspiration from existing and past IT automation tools.
It is not a replacement for Ansible, Terraform, Chef, etc, but operates in a similar way to support building your own focused CLI tools.
I expect that most SRE/DevOps staff are not going to be interested in creating something using the Swift language.
Instead, I'm assembling these pieces to support building my own custom playbooks and tools for managing remote hosts and services.
